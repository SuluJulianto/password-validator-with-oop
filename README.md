# Password Validator

This repository contains a simple password validation script implemented in various programming languages. The script checks the strength of a password based on length, special characters, and numbers.

## Python

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Input your password when prompted.
3. Review the summary to see the strength of your password.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Explanation
- The Python script embraces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
- The `PasswordValidator` class encapsulates attributes (`password` and `strength`) and methods (`validate_length`, `validate_special_chars`, `validate_numbers`, `validate_spaces`, `display_password`, and `summary`) related to password validation.
- The constructor (`__init__` method) initializes the object with an initial state.
- Methods utilize parameters for flexibility in validation based on special characters and numbers.
- The code follows the principles of encapsulation, grouping data and related functionality within the class.

## JavaScript

### Prerequisites
- Node.js

### Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Input your password when prompted.
3. Review the summary to see the strength of your password.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Explanation
- The JavaScript script implements OOP through object creation using prototypes.
- Functions act as methods of the `PasswordValidator` object, encapsulating the logic.
- The `password` and `strength` are properties of the object.
- The script follows the principles of encapsulation, where related data and functions are organized within an object.

## Ruby

### Prerequisites
- Ruby

### Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Input your password when prompted.
3. Review the summary to see the strength of your password.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Explanation
- The Ruby script embraces OOP principles.
- The `PasswordValidator` class encapsulates attributes (`password` and `strength`) and methods (`validate_length`, `validate_special_chars`, `validate_numbers`, `validate_spaces`, `display_password`, and `summary`) related to password validation.
- The constructor initializes the object with an initial state.
- Methods use parameters for flexibility in validation based on special characters and numbers.
- The code demonstrates encapsulation, grouping data and related functionality within the class.

## PHP

### Prerequisites
- PHP

### Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Input your password when prompted.
3. Review the summary to see the strength of your password.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Explanation
- The PHP script incorporates OOP concepts.
- The `PasswordValidator` class features attributes (`password` and `strength`) and methods (`validate_length`, `validate_special_chars`, `validate_numbers`, `validate_spaces`, `display_password`, and `summary`) for password validation.
- The constructor initializes the object with an initial state.
- Methods use parameters for flexibility in validation based on special characters and numbers.
- The code exemplifies encapsulation, organizing data and related functionality within the class.

## C

### Prerequisites
- GCC Compiler

### Usage
1. Compile the program: `gcc password_validator.c -o password_validator`
2. Run the executable.
3. Input your password when prompted.
4. Review the summary to see the strength of your password.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Explanation
- While C is not inherently an object-oriented language, the script emulates some OOP principles.
- It organizes functionality related to password validation in functions.
- The data (password and strength) is managed through function parameters.
- The script lacks true encapsulation and inheritance due to C's procedural nature.

## C++

### Prerequisites
- C++ Compiler

### Usage
1. Compile the program: `g++ password_validator.cpp -o password_validator`
2. Run the executable.
3. Input your password when prompted.
4. Review the summary to see the strength of your password.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Explanation
- The C++ script adheres to object-oriented principles.
- The `PasswordValidator` class encapsulates attributes (`password` and `strength`) and methods (`validate_length`, `validate_special_chars`, `validate_numbers`, `validate_spaces`, `display_password`, and `summary`) related to password validation.
- The constructor initializes the object with an initial state.
- Methods use parameters for flexibility in validation based on special characters and numbers.
- The code exemplifies encapsulation, where data and related functionality are grouped within the class.

## Java

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK)

### Usage
1. Compile the program: `javac PasswordValidator.java`
2. Run the compiled program: `java PasswordValidator`
3. Input your password when prompted.
4. Review the summary to see the strength of your password.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Explanation
- The Java script embraces OOP principles.
- The `PasswordValidator` class encapsulates attributes (`password` and `strength`) and methods (`validate_length`, `validate_special_chars`, `validate_numbers`, `validate_spaces`, `display_password`, and `summary`) for password validation.
- The constructor initializes the object with an initial state.
- Methods use parameters for flexibility in validation based on special characters and numbers.
- The code exemplifies encapsulation, where data and related functionality are grouped within the class.

## Golang

### Prerequisites
- Go Programming Language

### Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Input your password when prompted.
3. Review the summary to see the strength of your password.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Explanation
- Golang supports OOP concepts, but it takes a unique approach.
- While it doesn't have classes in the traditional sense, it uses struct types and methods associated with those types.
- The script uses a struct `PasswordValidator` with associated methods (`validateLength`, `validateSpecialChars`, `validateNumbers`, `validateSpaces`, `displayPassword`, and `summary`) to achieve OOP-like encapsulation.
